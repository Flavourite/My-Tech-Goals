      <h2>My Tech Goals</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Master Front-End Development Technologies</strong>
          <p>
            <strong>HTML:</strong> I will master HTML by creating
            well-structured and semantic web pages. I will focus on ensuring
            that my web pages are accessible and SEO-friendly, making use of
            tags correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>CSS:</strong> I will enhance my CSS skills by creating
            visually appealing websites. I will practice responsive design using
            Flexbox and Grid, and add interactivity with animations. This will
            help me create sites that look great on any device.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>JavaScript:</strong> I will deepen my understanding of
            JavaScript to add interactivity to my web projects. This includes
            mastering the DOM, event handling, and modern ES6+ features. I'll
            use asynchronous programming to handle data fetching and other
            asynchronous tasks efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>React:</strong> I will use React to build dynamic and
            responsive user interfaces. By understanding JSX, state and props,
            and hooks, I will create complex UIs that are easy to manage. I will
            also learn state management with Redux or Context API for larger
            applications.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build and Deploy 10+ Personal Projects</strong>
          <p>
            Building personal projects will allow me to apply my skills
            practically and build a strong portfolio. Here are some projects I
            plan to work on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Portfolio Website: I will create a personal website to showcase my
              projects, skills, and resume, highlighting my journey and
              achievements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Blog Platform: I will build a blog to share my learning
              experiences, tech topics, and tutorials, using a CMS like
              WordPress or building one from scratch with a framework.
            </li>
            <li>
              E-commerce Site: Developing an online store will give me hands-on
              experience with features like product listings, shopping cart, and
              checkout processes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Weather App: Creating a weather app will help me practice API
              integration by fetching and displaying real-time weather data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Task Manager: I will build a task management app to help users
              create, edit, delete, and filter tasks, improving my skills in
              user authentication and CRUD operations.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contribute to Open Source Projects</strong>
          <p>
            Contributing to open-source projects will help me collaborate with
            other developers and learn best practices. Here's my plan:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Find Projects: I will look for projects on GitHub that align with
              my interests and skills. I will start with issues labeled "good
              first issue" or "help wanted".
            </li>
            <li>
              Join Communities: I will participate in online communities like
              forums, Slack channels, or Discord servers related to the projects
              I'm interested in, to connect with other contributors and get
              support.
            </li>
            <li>
              Start Small: I'll begin with small contributions like fixing
              typos, improving documentation, or tackling minor bugs. As I gain
              confidence, I'll take on larger tasks and features.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learn Back-End Technologies</strong>
          <p>
            <strong>Node.js:</strong> I will use Node.js to run JavaScript on
            the server side, focusing on building scalable applications with a
            non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Express:</strong> Using Express, I will simplify the process
            of building web applications and APIs by utilizing its robust
            features for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>MongoDB:</strong> I will learn MongoDB to handle large
            volumes of unstructured data. This includes mastering CRUD
            operations, indexing, aggregation, and schema design to build
            efficient database-driven applications.
          </p>
